## Project Summary

In this project, we will explore and predict studentsâ€™ exam performance
in Electrical DC Machines based on their study time by using linear
regression (LN) and the K-nearest neighbours (K-NN) algorithm. This
result could help students gain insight into the necessary study time
for specific scores as well as help instructors better understand the
performance of students.

As a result of our analysis, we have found the Root mean square
prediction error(RMSPE) for our LN model to be 0.281, while the RMSPE of
the K-NN model is 0.257. Both types of regression have a prediction
error percentage of about 40% (therefore our accuracy is about 60%),
although the K-NN model is slightly better than the LN model here.

This can be attributed to the fact that exam performance could be
affected by other external factors such as health condition, student IQ,
stress level, and learning ability. Additionally, our data set may not be big enough
to directly draw a relationship between just study time and exam
performance.

The dataset we used was the User Knowledge Modeling Dataset provided by
\[UCL Machine Learning
Repository\]((<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/User+Knowledge+Modeling#>).
